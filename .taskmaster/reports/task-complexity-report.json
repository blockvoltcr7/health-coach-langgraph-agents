			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Build MongoDB Integration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the MongoDB integration layer into granular subtasks covering: (1) async CRUD method implementations for each domain operation, (2) connection pooling and health checks, (3) error handling and retry logic, (4) configuration management and environment variable integration, (5) schema validation and indexing, (6) integration test coverage for all methods, and (7) performance/load testing for connection pooling and bulk operations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a robust async data access layer with multiple domain-specific methods, advanced error handling, connection pooling, configuration management, and comprehensive testing. The need for atomic operations, schema validation, and performance under load increases both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. Industry best practices recommend separating concerns (connection, CRUD, validation, error handling, testing) into distinct subtasks to ensure maintainability and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Conversation State Management Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this service into subtasks for: (1) ConversationStateManager class scaffolding, (2) MongoDB and Mem0 integration adapters, (3) state transition logic and validation rules, (4) Pydantic model design and validation, (5) memory synchronization and consistency checks, and (6) concurrency and race condition testing.",
			"reasoning": "This service must orchestrate two data stores, enforce business rules on state transitions, and ensure data consistency. The integration of Pydantic models, validation logic, and memory sync adds to the cognitive and architectural complexity. Breaking down by integration, validation, and concurrency aligns with industry standards for distributed state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mem0 Async Client Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the Mem0 async client into subtasks for: (1) AsyncMemoryClient class and method scaffolding, (2) semantic search implementation, (3) memory categorization and scoring, (4) MongoDB snapshot integration, (5) error handling and performance optimization, and (6) comprehensive test coverage for all memory operations.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing an async client with semantic search, categorization, and scoring requires advanced async patterns and integration with another data store. The need for efficient search, categorization, and robust error handling increases both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. Industry best practices suggest modularizing by core functionality, search, integration, and testing."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Current Agent to Supervisor Agent",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the refactor into subtasks for: (1) removing sales-specific logic, (2) implementing routing decision logic, (3) integrating MongoDB state and message history analysis, (4) handoff recording and state transition management, and (5) routing decision explanation and analytics.",
			"reasoning": "This refactor requires significant logic changes, new routing algorithms, and integration with state and analytics systems. While not as complex as building a new system, the orchestration and backward compatibility considerations require careful modularization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Agent Handoff Mechanism",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the handoff mechanism into subtasks for: (1) LangGraph Command tool implementation, (2) handoff validation logic, (3) logging and analytics integration, (4) context passing between agents, and (5) comprehensive handoff scenario testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a robust handoff mechanism involves command pattern design, validation, logging, and context management. Each area introduces moderate complexity, especially for ensuring correctness and traceability across agent transitions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Update LangGraph Architecture for Multi-Agent System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the architecture update into subtasks for: (1) multi-node graph design, (2) StateGraph and ConversationState implementation, (3) conditional edge and handoff logic, (4) error handling and fallback mechanisms, (5) graph visualization tools, (6) debugging and developer tooling, and (7) integration and regression testing.",
			"reasoning": "Restructuring the core architecture for multi-agent support with stateful routing, error handling, and visualization is a high-complexity task. It requires deep changes to control flow, state management, and developer tooling, warranting a detailed breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Qualifier Agent",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the qualifier agent into subtasks for: (1) BANT criteria extraction and questioning logic, (2) qualification scoring algorithm, (3) natural conversation flow design, (4) MongoDB integration for qualification data, (5) disqualification and handoff logic, and (6) test coverage for scoring and conversation flow.",
			"reasoning": "Building a conversational agent with dynamic questioning, scoring, and integration with state and handoff logic is moderately complex. Ensuring natural flow and robust data handling requires separation of concerns and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Objection Handler Agent",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the objection handler into subtasks for: (1) real-time objection detection, (2) objection categorization and response frameworks, (3) objection tracking and resolution status, (4) personalization using Mem0 context, (5) escalation logic for complex objections, and (6) comprehensive scenario testing.",
			"reasoning": "This agent must combine NLP-based detection, categorization, response frameworks, and personalized context handling. The integration of escalation and tracking systems adds to the complexity, requiring modular development and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Closer Agent",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the closer agent into subtasks for: (1) personalized closing strategy generation, (2) dynamic offer creation, (3) urgency and next steps logic, (4) negotiation and payment handling, (5) follow-up scheduling, and (6) test coverage for closing scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "The closer agent must synthesize qualification and objection data, generate offers, handle negotiations, and manage follow-ups. Each area involves distinct logic and integration points, increasing overall complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Multi-Channel API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the API integration into subtasks for: (1) unified API endpoint design, (2) channel-specific formatting and feature handling, (3) conversation state management integration, (4) authentication and rate limiting, (5) webhook handlers for Instagram and WhatsApp, (6) analytics endpoint implementation, and (7) cross-channel consistency and reliability testing.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple channels with unified state, authentication, webhooks, and analytics introduces high architectural and implementation complexity. Each channel and feature area should be modularized for maintainability and scalability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing and Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the testing and analytics task into subtasks for: (1) end-to-end test suite development, (2) integration tests for conversation flows, (3) analytics dashboard implementation, (4) monitoring and alerting setup, (5) A/B testing framework, (6) debugging tool creation, and (7) validation of analytics and monitoring accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Building a comprehensive testing and analytics framework for a multi-agent, multi-channel system is highly complex. It requires deep integration, robust monitoring, and advanced analytics, each of which should be developed and validated as separate subtasks."
