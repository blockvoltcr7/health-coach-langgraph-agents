# MongoDB Vector Search Fix Summary

## The Problem
Your MongoDB Atlas vector search wasn't working because:
1. The Atlas Search index named "default" is not configured as a knnVector index
2. The embedding field needs to be explicitly defined as type "knnVector"

## Quick Fix Applied
I've updated the Gradio app with:
1. ✅ Changed index name from "vector_index" to "default" to match your Atlas
2. ✅ Added intelligent text search fallback for price queries
3. ✅ Fixed all Gradio UI errors (dropdown warnings, chatbot type)
4. ✅ Added auto-initialization on app startup

## To Make Vector Search Work Properly

### Option 1: Fix Atlas Index (Recommended)
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas → Your Cluster → Atlas Search tab
2. Edit the "default" index
3. Replace the configuration with:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true,
    "fields": {
      "embedding": {
        "type": "knnVector",
        "dimensions": 1024,
        "similarity": "cosine"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Use Text Search (Current Fallback)
The app now has smart text search that:
- Detects price-related queries ("how much", "cost", "price")
- Searches for dollar amounts ($299, etc.)
- Scores results based on query word matches
- Works immediately without Atlas changes

## Test Your App Now

1. **Restart the Gradio app**:
   ```bash
   ./gradio/launch.sh
   ```

2. **Search for**: "How much is the CEO Drip?"
   - With the improved text search, it should find the CEO Drip ($299)
   - Once you fix the Atlas index, vector search will provide even better results

## The CEO Drip Information
From your data:
- **Price**: $299
- **Duration**: 60 minutes  
- **Key Ingredients**: High-dose B-Complex, Vitamin C (2000mg), Magnesium, Zinc, B12, Amino Acids, Glutathione Push
- **Benefits**: Maximum cognitive enhancement and mental clarity

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test search directly
uv run python tests/db-tests/search_medspa_demo.py

# Debug the issue
uv run python gradio/debug_search.py

# Test Atlas search
uv run python gradio/test_atlas_search.py
```

The app should now work with text search fallback, and will work even better once you update the Atlas index configuration!
